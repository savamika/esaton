                <h2>Data Protection</h2>
                <p>The protection of your personal data is very important to us and we treat the data we receive confidentially. We therefore comply with the data protection regulations applicable in the Federal Republic of Germany (e.g. the EU General Data Protection Regulation - GDPR and the Federal Data Protection Act - BDSG) and the provisions of this privacy policy in all data processing operations, such as the collection, processing and use of data. In the following, we will inform you in detail about the type, scope and reason for data collection and the use of the data collected. Please read the following information carefully.</p>
                <h2>I. Data collection, processing and use</h2>
                <p>Anonymous use of the website
                    In principle, you can visit our website without providing any personal data. Any deviations from this principle can be found in the information below.
                    </p>
                <h2>Personal data</h2>
                <p>Personal data is information about personal or factual circumstances that enables the user to be identified, such as name, address, telephone number, e-mail address or date of birth. Such data is only collected, used and passed on by us if this is permitted by law or if you consent to the collection of data or if you provide us with this data voluntarily and for order processing. You provide us with personal data, for example, when placing an order or contacting us. Unless otherwise stated, we use the data received in each case only with your consent (see Art. 6 para. 1 a) GDPR - consent given for processing), for order processing or for processing your request (see Art. 6 para. 1 b) GDPR - contract fulfillment / pre-contractual measure). Once the order has been completed and our invoice has been paid in full, your data will be stored but will no longer be used and will be deleted after the retention periods specified in the statutory provisions (e.g. tax and commercial law) have expired, unless you expressly consent to the further use of your data. In all other respects, we comply with the applicable statutory retention periods when deleting data. Data that is not required for order processing will be deleted immediately and no longer used in the future if you revoke your consent and provided there are no retention obligations under commercial and tax law.</p>

                </h3>
                <h2>a) E-mail</h2>
                <p>At various points on our website, we refer to the possibility of contacting us by email. This applies, for example, to contacting us to place an order and in relation to other inquiries. The personal data transmitted will only be used and stored by us to process your respective request and possible follow-up questions. By using various technical and organizational options, your data will be stored inaccessible to third parties when communicating with us by e-mail. Unfortunately, however, we cannot guarantee complete data security with this form of communication, so we recommend that you contact us by post if you have sensitive information or require a high level of confidentiality. The legal basis for the corresponding data collection in the context of an e-mail contact results, for example, from Art. 6 para. 1 a) GDPR (consent given for processing), Art. 6 para. 1 b) GDPR (contract fulfilment / pre-contractual measures) or from Art. 6 para. 1 f) GDPR (legitimate interests of an economic nature to optimize the offer).

Although we endeavor to only use content from providers who only require the IP address to provide the content, it is possible that third-party providers may store the IP address (e.g. for statistical purposes). As far as this is recognizable and possible for us, we will inform you about this. The legal basis for the collection of data in the context of the aforementioned services results from Art. 6 para. 1 f) GDPR (legitimate interests of an economic nature to optimize the offer).</p>
